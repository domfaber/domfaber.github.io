        <!-- Article content -->
        <article class="article-content">
            <p>
                In the fast-moving world of AI startups, there's something refreshing about Base44's story. One founder, one product, and an $80M exit that happened almost quietly compared to the noise we usually see in tech.
            </p>

            <h2>The Power of Focus</h2>

            <p>
                What strikes me most about Base44 isn't the exit multiple or the timeline—it's the laser focus. While everyone else was building AI platforms that could do everything, they built something that did one thing exceptionally well.
            </p>

            <p>
                This reminds me of the early days of successful SaaS companies. The winners weren't the ones with the most features; they were the ones that solved a specific problem better than anyone else.
            </p>

            <h2>Speed and Clarity</h2>

            <p>
                In today's AI landscape, speed isn't just about moving fast—it's about clarity of vision. Base44 knew exactly what they were building and for whom. No feature creep, no pivots, no trying to be everything to everyone.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The best products are born from constraints, not from infinite possibilities."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This constraint-driven approach is becoming increasingly important as AI tools proliferate. The market doesn't need another general-purpose AI assistant. It needs focused solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons for AI Founders</h2>

            <p>
                If you're building an AI product today, Base44's story offers some clear takeaways:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pick your lane early</strong> - Don't try to solve every AI problem</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on distribution</strong> - The best AI is useless if people can't access it</li>
                <li><strong>Build for today's workflows</strong> - Don't force users to change everything</li>
                <li><strong>Measure what matters</strong> - Revenue and retention beat demo day applause</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Right Moment</h2>

            <p>
                Timing in AI feels different than in previous tech waves. The underlying technology is moving so fast that being too early is just as dangerous as being too late. Base44 found that sweet spot where the technology was mature enough to be reliable, but the market wasn't yet saturated.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the opportunity for focused AI companies right now. While the big players are still figuring out their AI strategies, there's room for specialized solutions that do one thing incredibly well.
            </p>

            <p>
                The $80M exit isn't just a number—it's validation that focused, well-executed AI products can create significant value without trying to change the world overnight.
